## How to contribute

We love pull requests. Here is a quick guide:

1. You need to have a JDK (at least version 1.8) installed.
2. Fork the repo (see https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
3. Create a new branch from master.
4. Ensure that you have a clean state by running `./gradlew clean build`.
5. Add your change together with a test (tests are not needed for refactorings and documentation changes).
6. Run `./gradlew clean build` again and ensure all tests are passing.
7. Push to your fork/branch and submit a pull request.
8. Add the following line to your Pull Request description:
```
I hereby agree to the terms of the Taskwarrior Java client License Agreement.
```
9. Now you are waiting on us. We review your pull request and at least leave some comments.

*Note:* If you are thinking of providing a fix for one of the bugs or feature requests, it is usually
a good idea to add a comment to the bug to make sure that there is agreement on how we should proceed.
